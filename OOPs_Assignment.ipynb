        "\n",
        "**Answer** : OOPs is the programming paradigm created around the concept of \" object \" which are the instance of \" Classes \". It contains data (Field, often  known as Attibite or properties) and code (procedure, often known as method).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts of OOP:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "  - Defines attribute and metod that the object created from the calss will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Object:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It is instance of class.\n",
        "  - It represent specific implementation of class with actual value.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Hides the internal state of an object and only allows access through public methods.\n",
        "  - Helps protect object integrity by preventing outside interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "  - promotes code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The ability to take many forms.\n",
        "  - A function or method can behave differently based on the object that invokes it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Hides comolex implementation details and shows only the essential feature of the object.\n",
        "  - Helps in reducing programming complexity."
